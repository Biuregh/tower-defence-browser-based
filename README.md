## Game Description

**Gridwatcher** is a browser-based tower defense game where players strategically place different types of towers to stop waves of enemies from reaching the end of a path. Each wave gets progressively more difficult, and the player must balance defense and resource management. The objective is to survive as long as possible while upgrading the base and defending the grid.

I chose to build a tower defense game because it offered an ideal balance of creative freedom and technical complexity.
